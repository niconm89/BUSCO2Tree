**About BUSCO2Tree**

This pipeline was developed to automatize the downstream phylogenomic analyses to obtain a species tree from BUSCO outputs. 
We provide data example to test funcionallity. Data was obtained from a study we have recently published [1]. Briefly, thirteen Drosophila genomes were assessed using BUSCO v5.4.2 to obtain completeness scores and Eukaryote single-copy orthologs (BUSCO groups). Common BUSCOs among all genomes were the input of this pipeline.
